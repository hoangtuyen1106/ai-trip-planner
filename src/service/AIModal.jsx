Prices fluctuate greatly, so check rates well in advance and be flexible with your dates.\n*   **Transportation:** The Deuce bus is the cheapest way to get around the Strip and Downtown. Walking is also a great option.\n*   **Food:** Look for affordable restaurants, food courts, or happy hour deals.  Consider buying some groceries to save money on snacks and drinks.\n*   **Entertainment:** Focus on free attractions.  Many hotels offer free shows or attractions.\n*   **Timing:** Traveling during the off-season (e.g., weekdays, excluding holidays and major events) will save you money on hotels and flights.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Prices:** Prices are estimates and can vary widely based on the time of year, day of the week, and availability.  Always check current pricing before booking.\n*   **Reservations:** Consider making reservations for shows or restaurants, especially if you\'re traveling during a busy period.\n*   **Walking:** Be prepared to do a lot of walking! The Strip is longer than it looks.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings and take precautions against pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.\n*   **Flexibility:** Be flexible with your itinerary.  Sometimes the best experiences are the unexpected ones!\n\nEnjoy your trip to Las Vegas!\n',

It\'s often a good balance of price, location, and amenities (including the free Wildlife Habitat).\n*   **Day 1 Focus:** Concentrated Day 1 on the South Strip, including iconic free attractions and some cheap/fun stops like M&M\'s World and the Coca-Cola Store.\n*   **Day 2 Downtown Emphasis:** Kept Day 2 focused on Downtown, highlighting Fremont Street, the Mob Museum (optional, but highly recommended), and Container Park. Included Pizza Rock as a solid, reasonably priced dinner option.\n*   **Day 3 Mid-Strip and Relaxation:** Day 3 focuses on the mid-Strip area, with the LINQ Promenade, the free Flamingo Wildlife Habitat, and a cheap lunch option at In-N-Out Burger.  The final activity is flexible: enjoy your hotel pool or explore another grand hotel.\n*   **More Specific Time Travel:** Provided more specific time estimates, including notes about walking times and bus options.\n*   **Consistent Budget Tips:**  Kept a consistent set of budget tips.\n*   **Clearer Ticket Pricing:**  Made it clear when something is free to enter but has costs for specific activities (like M&M\'s World).\n* **Added More Amenities**: Added amenities details for each of the hotel.\n\nThis revised itinerary provides a good balance of free activities, affordable food options, and iconic Vegas experiences, all while staying within a cheap budget.  It\'s also structured to minimize travel time between locations on each day. Remember to check showtimes and opening hours for attractions, and be prepared for crowds, especially in the evenings.\n',

This allows for significantly cheaper accommodation. The itinerary is adjusted to accommodate this.\n*   **Free Shuttle Emphasis:** The *free shuttle to the Strip* amenity is highlighted for each hotel, and the itinerary is built around using this service.\n*   **Day 1 tailored to hotel choice:** Day 1 is now dependent on where you stay.\n*   **Downtown Summerlin Added:** included as a bonus.\n*   **Downtown on Last Day**: included in day 3, where departure also included in plan.\n\nThis is a major shift in the strategy, prioritizing *very* low accommodation costs by staying off-Strip, and then leveraging the free shuttle service to access the main tourist areas. This is probably the *cheapest* feasible way to do Vegas. Be aware that the free shuttle service may have limited hours and can be crowded, so plan accordingly. Also be prepared for longer travel times getting to the Strip.\n',

This offers a great balance of affordability and access. Ellis Island is especially good for cheap eats and drinks.\n*   **Day 1: South Strip Focus:** Concentrates on the south end of the Strip, with easy walking access to attractions like New York-New York and Excalibur. Includes In-N-Out Burger as a classic, cheap meal.\n*   **Day 2: Central Strip and Free Attractions:** Focuses on the must-see free attractions of the Bellagio (Conservatory and Fountains), the Flamingo Wildlife Habitat, and the LINQ Promenade. All are within walking distance of each other.\n*   **Day 3: Downtown and Departure:**  Includes Fremont Street, the Mob Museum, Container park and the departure plan.\n*   **Walking Emphasized:** The itinerary maximizes walking, especially on Days 1 and 2, to minimize transportation costs.\n* **Added In-N-Out Burger & The Mob Museum**: As per the food and museum options.\n\nThis plan represents a very achievable, cheap Vegas trip for a couple. It leverages proximity to the Strip for walkability, focuses on free activities, and suggests affordable dining.\n',
